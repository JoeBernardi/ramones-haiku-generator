They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop
Hey ho, let's go
Shoot'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat
Beat on the brat with a baseball bat
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh-oh
What can you do?
What can you do?
With a brat like that always on your back
What can you do? (lose?)

Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German town
Today your love, tomorrow the world

Get the glory like Charles Manson
Gonna smile, I'm gonna laugh
You're gonna get a blood bath
And in a moment of passion
Get the glory like Charles Manson
You gotta go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Now I know the score
I don't need you anymore
Don't want you cause you're a bore
I need somebody good I need a miracle
Should I take a chance on her?
One bullet in the cylinder
Gonna smile, I'm gonna laugh
They're gonna want my autograph
And in a moment of passion
Get the glory like Charles Manson
You gotta go go go go goodbye
Glad to see you go go go go goodbye
Goodbye
